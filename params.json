{"name":"Sorkandu","tagline":"","body":"# Sorkandu\r\n  Corpus is a collection of words, tagged or annotated with their grammar components.\r\n\r\n  We can use the text corpus to do the linguistic researches and projects.\r\n\r\n  There are many projects run by government and many universities to create\r\n  a text corpus for Tamil Language. Unfortunately, they are not open for public usage.\r\n\r\n  We have to create a system to create a Corpus for Tamil, which is public.\r\n\r\n  So that anyone can use the corpus data.\r\n\r\n  Collecting words, assigning relevant tags, edit the tags are painful job to do manually and individually.\r\n\r\n  This web application will enable the users to login, select a word, tag it properly, move to next word.\r\n\r\n  The admin can load the words and do all the administrative tasks.\r\n\r\n## System Dependencies\r\n  * Linux / other unix / OSX \r\n  * Ruby 2.1\r\n  * Rails 4\r\n  * mysql 2\r\n\r\n## How to run\r\n```bash\r\n  git clone git@github.com:sathia27/corpus.git\r\n  cd corpus\r\n  bundle install\r\n  export CORPUS_DB=corpus_development\r\n  export CORPUS_DB_USER=<YOUR MYSQL USERNAME>\r\n  export CORPUS_DB_PASSWORD=<YOUR MYSQL PASSWORD>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Test url\r\n  http://corpus-sathia.rhcloud.com/\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n To keep corpus* improving we need all help we can get.
